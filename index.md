## API Specs

Below you'll find links to the first *prototype* API, which is almost implemented
in the Life Monitor `master` branch.  Feel free to explore it, but keep in mind
that **it will not last long and it will not be supported in the future**.

The more feature complete API is in the `extended-api` branch and we expect to
adopt it in the following weeks.

* Formatted with RapiDoc:  [lm-openapi-rapidoc.html](./lm-openapi-rapidoc.html)
* Static page automatically created with openapi-generator: [lm-openapi-html](./lm-openapi-html/index.html)

You can find the raw YAML API specifications in [the source code repository](https://github.com/crs4/life_monitor/tree/master/specs).
