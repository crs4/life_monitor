LifeMonitor is a service to support the **sustainability** and **reusability**
of published computational workflows.

The collapse [[1](#hinsen2019)] over time of the software and services on
which computational workflows depend is destructive to their reusability, and
to the reproducibility of work for which they were used; this phenomenon
can be caused by an API change that is not backwards compatible, a regression
in a tool whose version was not pinned, a change in URL of an external
resource, etc. Frequent **testing** is crucial to the preservation of workflow
health, allowing to expose problems when they arise and providing a
machine-actionable way to verify changes to the workflow
structure. LifeMonitor aims to facilitate the maintenance of computational
workflows, supporting their **reusability** over time, with a strong focus on
testing and test monitoring.

The project's main goals are to:

* Serve as a central aggregation point for workflow test statuses and outputs
  from various testing services (e.g., [GitHub
  Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions),
  [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/),
  etc.).
* Facilitate the application of workflow best practices, including periodic
  automated execution of workflow tests.
* Integrate with [WorkflowHub](https://about.workflowhub.eu/).
* Assist in test suite creation and workflow maintenance.

## Quick Start

:bulb: If you just want to play around or get familiar with the API, use the
[dev instance of LifeMonitor](https://app.dev.lifemonitor.eu) (note that the dev
instance could be wiped out at any time with no warning).

1. Install the [LifeMonitor GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/lifemonitor) on
   your workflow's repository;
2. Follow the installation process to enable issue checks;
3. Follow the instructions provided by the bot through pull requests and/or
   issues opened on your workflow repository to configure [test
   monitoring](./lm_test_monitoring) and improve the application of workflow
   sustainability best practices;
4. Profit!

Once installed, the LifeMonitor app can be configured to:

* support the configuration of [test monitoring](./lm_test_monitoring) by the
  LifeMonitor service;
* notify [WorkflowHub](https://about.workflowhub.eu/) and
  [LifeMonitor](https://app.lifemonitor.eu/) about new workflow releases;
* analyze the workflow through a series of checks to signal possible
  improvements pertaining to maintenance best practices.

See the
[page describing the LifeMonitor GitHub app](lm_wft_best_practices_github_app)
for more detailed information on what it does and how it can be configured.

If you don't want to install the GitHub app, you can still use LifeMonitorâ€™s
test monitoring and periodic test execution features. Follow [the instructions
on configuring test monitoring](./lm_test_monitoring).

If you still don't have tests for your workflow or you haven't created an
automated testing pipeline, see [our page on general workflow testing
tips](./reference_general_workflow_testing_tips).
