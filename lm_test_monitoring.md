# LifeMonitor Test Monitoring

What LM does
You must have tests for your workflow and their automated execution must be implemented on one of the testing services supported by LM (a, b, c, …)
If you don’t have these yet:
See the “General workflow testing tips” page for creating tests
See the “Support for best practices” section for help enabling automated execution
