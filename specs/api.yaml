    *Workflow sustainability service*

    Life Monitor aims to facilitate the sharing, execution and monitoring of
    workflow tests over time, ensuring that deviations from the workflow's
    correct operation are detected and communicated to the workflow authors so
    that they might be solved, thus extending the useful life of the workflow.

    Life Monitor is being developed as part of the [EOSC-Life project](https://www.eosc-life.eu/).

        Submit a new test instance for the specified test suite.

        There are two main types of test instances:

        1. **"managed"** (not supported yet): directly managed by LifeMonitor
        2. **"unmanaged"**: hosted on an external testing service and monitored
        by LifeMonitor (LifeMonitor retrieves information on the test status
        through the service's API).
