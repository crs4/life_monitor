        POSTing this resource results in the creation of a new test suite
        instance.  That is, a specific test suite hosted and executed on a
        specific testing service.

        Two types of test instances can be created:  managed and unmanaged.
        A *managed* test instance is managed by LifeMonitor on its
        own testing infrastructure.
        An *unmanaged" test instance is hosted on an external testing service
        and LifeMonitor can only monitor it (query information about test
        results through the service's API).
